For the first workshop for OOP244, it let me get more familiar with the C++ language. It is different from the IPC we had last semester. 

What I get much more familiar is modular programming, although we have it last semester in IPC, but I can't separate different parts into different implementation files or header files precisely. In this workshop, I put the code related to the movie only into movie.cpp and the code related to the data files only into file.cpp. This practice made me go further on modular programming.

The most difficult part for me in this workshop is which file I should include in front of the code. For instance, I was confused about #ifndef #define #endif #include<iostream>, where should I put them, also about namespace, these concepts are new to me, it took me a long time to figure out which one I should use in a header file, and which one I should use in the implementation file and how to use them.
