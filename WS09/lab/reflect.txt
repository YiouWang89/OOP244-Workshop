For workshop9, the "search" module is not hard, the code needs to write is short. However, when I  try to write the template for search directly, I made many mistakes. Then I recall that the teacher told us that try to write the regular function at first, then switch it to a template. This way made the whole process much easier.

For the project, I practice more on inheritance, virtual function and overloading, the only thing I feel a little bit hard is to remember which part or which implement file include the specified function I need. There is one more consideration, I believe that I am skilled to write the code based on the instruction. However, if there is no instruction, and I need to complete a project like what I am dealing with, it will be a huge challenge for me. A project does not only need the code, it also needs to be designed properly. I think I need more practice for this part.
