It is not very hard to understand the concept of inheritance, virtual function and pure virtual function. The recent workshop and milestone for the project give me a good chance to practice what I have learned from the lecture. The only issue I have is that there are so many files, all the heard files, implementation files, it is hard for me to get a clear map for each file, especially the implementation files which include the main function. As each time, the instructor will provide the main function for the student to test if the code they wrote is working or not. I always feel lost to see the code which is not written by myself, if I would like to understand it, I have to go through all the files at least 10 times.
