For this workshop, the two most difficult concept for me is copy constructor and copy assignment. At first, I don't understand why we need a copy constructor. I checked the recording lecture for a long time, watch the same part again and again, and finally, I get it. A copy constructor is to avoid the bad copy which will happen in our project.

However, the problem I met in the workshop is not the copy constructor and copy assignment. I was stuck in "test 3", I pass the cout as the parameter to the display function, and the result can only display on the screen, not the "output.txt" file. I stuck in this problem for a long time then I realize I should pass (ostream& os) os to the display function. After that, I have another question, fin and fout belong to the fstream header file, why a reference of ostream can pass fin or fout as its parameter? So I search on Google, it seems that fstream is kind of belong to iostream, so it can pass fin and fout.
