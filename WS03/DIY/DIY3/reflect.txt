For Workshop3, I learn how to create a function as a member of the class or the structure and also the concept of private and public.

The most difficult thing I met in this workshop is how to call a member function outside of this class or structure. Especially when assigning an array as that class, I don't know how to call the function for the specific element. Also, I made a mistake in the DIY part, I declare a function A without the const keyword, then I declare the other function B with const. When I try to call function A as the condition to check if it is true, the program can go to the next step, but there is an alert under function A, I checked all my code and find nothing, trapped in this problem for a long time, then I decided to find the solution form Google. Finally, I got the reason that I cannot call a non-const method with a const object. Then I solved this problem perfectly.
