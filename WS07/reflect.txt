For workshop 7 and final project milestone 1, I feel both these two are easy for me. The most difficult thing is to remember the syntax for derived classes and functions in the hierarchy. I have to check the post code on GitHub several times to make my syntax right.

On the whole, I did these two labs smoothly. However, I find out that I am getting hard on the live lecture session than before. Sometimes I cant even catch up with you, there is so much content in one session, and my brain should work perfectly quickly and clear so that I can get all the concepts. When there is a concept I am not very clear, I need seconds to figure it out, but after I finally get through the concept, I find out that you already go to the next question and I have missed numbers of content. It feels like after the lecture session, my brain is totally full.
