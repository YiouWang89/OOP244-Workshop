For workshop2, I learn the concept of function overloading, reference and dynamic memory.

When studying based on the study note and watch the recording for the lecture all the concepts look easy to understand. However, things were getting hard when I try to use them by myself when I was doing the workshop.

I take time on the reference. At the very first beginning, for the read overloading function, I used both pointers to solve the problem as I am more familiar with pointer than the reference. According to the instruction for this workshop, I should use reference, so I decided to change the pointer to reference, but I don't know where should I put '&'. Both the read function passes the value perfectly to the parameter. However, I just cannot assign those values to the variable after I call the read function, it seems didn't store in that parameter at all. I check the study note and recording several times then I figure out I should put that '&' after the type of parameter. I feel excited after I finally solved it, it cost me almost half an hour.

Another problem I meet was at the time when I try to submit the work, the matrix indicated that although my output is correct, there was a memory leak. I used delete [] students at the bottom of the code, I believe this statement deletes all the memory I allocate to the array. Obviously, I was wrong, so I check my code and find I allocate new memory for two different arrays, one is the students, another is the name for the student, so I have to delete it too.

This workshop is really helpful, I am get more clear about refernce and dynamic memory.
